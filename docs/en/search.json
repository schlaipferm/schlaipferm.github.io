CARBONIQUE is a 5-year research program, jointly funded by Quebec’s Ministry of the Environment and the Fight Against Climate Change, Wildlife and Parks through their 2030 Plan for a Green Economy, an NSERC Alliance - Advantage grant and Ducks Unlimited Canada with in-kind contributions from all project partners.\nThis project aims to improve understanding the carbon sequestration capacity of key wetland types across Canada to better quantify the role of wetlands as nature-based climate solutions to fight climate change. This includes quantifying the net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) of four types of wetlands under natural conditions (open bog, treed bog, treed swamp, and coastal marsh) to help prioritizing the protection and conservation of areas with the strongest capacity to mitigate climate change. We will also quantify the NECB of the same wetland types under disturbed conditions as knowledge about the impacts of anthropogenic disturbances on the carbon balances of these wetlands. This comparison between natural and disturbed conditions will help our partners (Ministère de l’Environnement, de la Lutte contre le changement climatique, de la Faune et des Parcs (MELCCFP), Ducks Unlimited Canada and Nature Conservancy Canada - Québec) to support decisions for carbon stocks conservation, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and optimization of carbon sequestration in soils and biomass.\nThe NECB approach integrates land-atmosphere gas exchange (i.e., vertical fluxes), carbon accumulation in soils and biomass, and lateral carbon export (i.e., lateral fluxes) in its various forms. This will be realized through a watershed-scale continuum approach. The support of the Quebec government in this project request is significant because the proposed research will have concrete implications through conservation and land-use practices not only for Quebec but also for Canada.",

The locations of our flux towers in southern Quebec can be seen here: https://carbonique.ca/FieldSiteMaps/\nLéonie, the amazing coordinator for both the C-Paleo Lab and the CARCLIQUE Research Chair, documented the team’s efforts to set up the two towers at the natural bog sites at the Lac-à-la-Tortue peatland complex in March and April. The video can be watched via the C-Paleo Lab’s YouTube channel.\nLater in the spring work continued at the Lac Saint-Pierre restored marsh site, where our flux tower sits on top of a floating platform in the middle of the small pond that was created when the site was rewetted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll installations came with their own set of challenges (see photo evidence - snow, storms that toppled over solar panels and towers, lightning strikes!) and we could not be prouder of our incredible technical team for persisting through all of them!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe would also like to thank our collaborators at UBC, Zoran Nesic and Rick Kettler, for their invaluable help and also extend our gratitude to TechnoPieux and Élite Échafaudage. Without their expertise these installations would not have been possible. Last but not least, a big thank you to all of the students and summer interns who came out to the field with us to make these installations feasible.\nPlease have a look at the photos below for some more impressions of the new flux tower sites and the installation work."

    "text": "This research is a unique opportunity to improve understanding and prediction of the potential role of wetlands as Nature-based Climate Solutions (NbCS). Our project is the largest and most comprehensive and integrative assessment of wetland carbon dynamics and balances in Canada to date and will provide much needed new data to carry out robust, evidence-based assessments of the capacity of natural and disturbed wetlands to mitigate climate change. This research is unique in integrating all components of the C cycle to provide a robust and realistic assessment of C and GHG budgets across wetland ecosystems that are of particular importance in the Canadian landscape. By integrating lateral and vertical fluxes and combining them with soil core observations, our work will allow us to develop reliable estimates of Net Ecosystem Carbon Balance (NECB) and assess the long-term C dynamics and the impacts of anthropogenic disturbances on wetlands. Our research and collaborations also provide a unique opportunity for improving wetland biogeochemical models.\nSpecifically, our work will further improve wetland C cycle science in Quebec and Canada, provide key information for policy makers, guide the management and restoration of wetlands for different levels of governments, contribute to climate change mitigation accounting, and support climate action initiatives across regional, provincial, and federal levels. Furthermore, by improving biogeochemical models, we will contribute to better quantifying C emissions and removals from land-use change and management of wetlands in Canada, which will ultimately reduce uncertainty in Canadian inventory reporting.",

C stocks (kg m-2) and long-term C sequestration rates (kg m-2 yr-1) will be quantified under natural and disturbed conditions in the four wetland categories (open bogs, forested bogs, forested swamps and coastal marshes) to estimate the impact of disturbances, primarily related to drainage, on their C sequestration potential. We will also compare whether the C budgets measured by vertical and horizontal fluxes (Objective 2 and 3) corresponds to the variation of soil C sequestration through the &lt;150-year time period. The results of these comparisons are of importance both technically (i.e., validating the closure of the C budget) and scientifically (i.e., exploring the long-term vs. short-term dynamics of the C budgets), and will result in: 1) a synthesis of C stock and sequestration rates in the soil and plant biomass of natural and disturbed wetlands across southern Quebec, and 2) the development of a decision tool for hotspots of C in wetland conservation. We expect that while natural wetlands will act as net C sinks, disturbed wetlands may be C sources, with the magnitude of the source increasing with the level of disturbance.",

An eddy covariance (EC) tower will be installed in each wetland type both natural and disturbed for a total of 8 towers supported by the MELCCFP. A 9th tower will be contributed from McGill in a restored site near Lac Saint-Pierre (LSP). These towers will measure vertical (gaseous) fluxes including net CO2 exchange (NEP, which is the balance between gross ecosystem productivity and ecosystem respiration) and net CH4 exchange (the balance between methanogenesis and methanotrophy). Continuous, year-round EC observations will provide robust annual vertical C and GHG budgets for each site. While we expect lower CH4 emissions from disturbed (i.e., drained wetlands), we anticipate that this will be outweighed by significantly higher CO2 emissions, making the disturbed sites a larger net GHG source than the natural wetlands. For each site, the impact of disturbance on fluxes will also be investigated. Additionally, the quasi-continuous nature of these C and GHG flux measurements coupled with ancillary measurements (e.g., radiation, temperature, relative humidity, soil moisture, water table depth) will allow us to investigate the dominant controls on GHG fluxes and assess how C fluxes will respond to a changing climate and intensifying disturbance regimes.",

This will require a detailed characterization of the water balance and the hydrologic connectivity with surface and groundwater in each of the target ecosystems. Additionally, a detailed biogeochemical quantification (including dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), partitional pressure of CO2 and CH4 (pCO2 and pCH4, respectively), and water chemistry) of the outflows of the studied wetlands including interstitial and groundwater will be conducted. This will allow us to quantify the net lateral C and GHG budgets of natural and disturbed wetlands across southern Quebec. These comparative case studies will allow us to derive general patterns of C export based on landscape and hydrologic features, which will be used to upscale C export at a regional level. Mechanistic models of lateral C export will also be developed to assess how climate-induced change and human disturbance may impact this important aspect of the wetland ecosystem C balance. We expect that C export will comprise a significant yet varying component of the C budget of the different wetland ecosystems, but that in all cases, these lateral C fluxes will be essential for closure of the NECB.",
