    "text": "Name\nDr. Michelle Garneau\n\n\nEmail\ngarneau.michelle@uqam.ca\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Michelle Garneau initiated the project and built the strong collaborations with the Quebec government and the two other partners over the past year. Dr. Garneau is a Full Professor at the Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM), where she has successfully led several research projects using innovative methods to document the impact of climate variations on C sequestration through time and space. The research carried out by her group over the past 22 years was used as a basis to modify and improve the provincial “Loi sur les milieu humides et hydriques” (LMHH) (The Wetland Habitat Law) through the addition of a specific regulation for the conservation of C stocks in different types of wetlands in Quebec. She has been asked to lead the Quebec wetland research and climate mitigation program that has resulted in the present project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nDr. Sara Helen Knox\n\n\nEmail\nsara.knox@mcgill.ca\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Sara Knox is an Assistant Professor in Geography at McGill University (and formerly held a Canada Research Chair in Eco-Meteorology at UBC). Her research investigates how wetland-atmosphere exchanges of GHG, water and energy fluxes respond to a changing climate and disturbance, and how we can modify wetland management practices for climate change adaptation and mitigation. Dr. Knox has made several important contributions to understanding the climatic role of conserving and restoring wetlands across North America, with a focus on restored peatlands, wetlands in the Prairie Pothole Region of Canada, and tidal wetlands. Dr. Knox also co-led the international FLUXNET-CH4 initiative, which is a global database of eddy covariance CH4 flux measurements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nDr. Oliver Sonnentag\n\n\nEmail\noliver.sonnentag@umontreal.ca\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Oliver Sonnentag is an Assistant Professor and holds the Canada Research Chair in Atmospheric Biogeosciences in High Latitudes at the Université de Montréal. His research aims to understand changes in land surface-atmosphere interactions in response to increasing natural and anthropogenic pressures. He has established a transect of eddy covariance towers along a 2000-km permafrost and climate gradient across the boreal forest of northwestern Canada. He also uses remote sensing and modelling techniques to study changes in Arctic-boreal ecosystem composition, structure, and function. In addition, Sonnentag leads a training network to build local Indigenous capacity in the Northwest Territories for community-based monitoring of ecosystem changes, and is a co-investigator in NSERC CREATE LEAP, “training tomorrow’s LEAders in Permafrost thaw and northern research”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nDr. Vincent Maire\n\n\nEmail\nVincent.Maire@uqtr.ca\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Vincent Maire is a Professor in Environmental Sciences at the Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières (UQTR). He formerly held a Junior Research Chair at UQTR in arctic functional ecology, focusing on the feedbacks of arctic vegetation changes on the dynamics of permafrost and soil functioning, including CO2 and CH4 fluxes. His research focuses on how properties and changes of vegetation and microbial communities modify soil cycling of C and nitrogen in arctic, temperate, dryland and wetland ecosystems. Since 2019, he has been involved in the Pole d’Expertise du Lac Saint-Pierre, which evaluates the role of agricultural disturbances on the functioning of the Lac Saint-Pierre shoreline. As part of this, he determined how agricultural disturbances have modified the sequestration of biomass and C into soils and the fluxes of CO2 and CH4 to the atmosphere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nDr. Alexandre Roy\n\n\nEmail\nAlexandre.Roy@uqtr.ca\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Alexandre Roy, is an Assistant Professor at Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières (UQTR) and UQTR Research Chair in Northern Remote Sensing. He has worked for more than twelve years in modeling and remote sensing of the cryosphere. Since 2014, in addition to a strong expertise in snow and freeze/thaw cycles monitoring, he has contributed to enhancing the understanding of the relationships between the cryosphere and C fluxes in high latitude environments. He works in close collaboration with various space agencies (NASA, Canadian Space Agency and European Space Agency) to improve surface key variables monitoring related to C fluxes such as soil moisture, soil temperature, surface freeze/thaw state and vegetation water content.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nDr. Marc-André Bourgault\n\n\nEmail\nMarc-Andre.Bourgault@ggr.ulaval.ca\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Marc-André Bourgault is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Geography at Laval University. His area of expertise is data analysis and numerical modelling of wetland hydrology. His research investigates the hydrological and biogeochemical interactions in wetlands as well as their capacity to reduce flood risk and accumulate C. He is also involved in different agro- and hydro-climatological projects in collaboration with a broad group of researchers in which he analyzes climate simulation data and develops new indicators to quantify the risk of climate change on various socio-economic sectors. He is in charge of of a research axis in Réseau inondations intersectoriel du Québec (RIISQ), an active collaborator in centrEAU, and a research member of Institut en environnement, développement et société (Institut EDS).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nDr. Paul A. del Giorgio\n\n\nEmail\ndel_giorgio.paul@uqam.ca\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Paul A. del Giorgio is a Full Professor at Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM). He is an aquatic ecologist and biogeochemist. Since 2009 he has held the NSERC – HydroQuébec Research Chair in Carbon Biogeochemistry in Boreal Aquatic Systems (CarBBAS Chair) and has led one of the largest studies to date of greenhouse gas and C dynamics in rivers and lakes in the remote, water-rich boreal biome of Canada. His integrative aquatic research in the boreal biome has contributed to a radical re-evaluation of aquatic / terrestrial links and of the role of inland waters, including hydroelectric reservoirs, in the global C cycle. He has a strong record of developing fruitful partnerships with industry and other stake holders, including Hydro Québec and the Cree Nation of Eeyou Ischee in the James Bay, among others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nDr. Evelyne Thiffault\n\n\nEmail\nEvelyne.Thiffault@sbf.ulaval.ca\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Evelyne Thiffault is an Associate Professor in forest ecology and management at the department of wood and forest sciences at Université Laval and is a member of the Renewable Materials Research Centre. Her work focuses on land management and wood production for climate change mitigation. Her research program involves fundamental and applied studies of ecological processes related to C cycling between the ecosystems and the atmosphere as influenced by climate and forest management, along with work on the life-cycle of wood products and their role for meeting the needs of societies for materials and energy."
