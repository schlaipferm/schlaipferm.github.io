Dr. Michelle Garneau initiated the project and built the strong collaborations with the Quebec government and the two other partners over the past year. Dr. Garneau is a Full Professor at the Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM), where she has successfully led several research projects using innovative methods to document the impact of climate variations on C sequestration through time and space. The research carried out by her group over the past 25 years contributed to the development of the Act respecting the conservation of wetlands and bodies of water by recognizing the importance of the carbon sequestration function in wetlands and their conservation for climate change mitigation. She has been asked to lead the Quebec wetland research and climate mitigation program that has resulted in the present project.

::::

Dr. Scott J. Davidson is an Assistant Professor of Wetland Carbon Dynamics at the Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM) and leads the Wetland Resilience Research Group. His research investigates how wetlands across Arctic, boreal, alpine, and temperate regions respond to climate change, land use, and disturbance, with a focus on carbon cycling and greenhouse gas emissions. Dr. Davidson’s work combines field measurements, remote sensing, and ecosystem modelling to understand the resilience of wetlands and their role in climate regulation. He has made key contributions to advancing knowledge of how wetland conservation and restoration support climate mitigation and has engaged in international efforts to build research networks and community science initiatives.

Dr. Sara Knox is an Assistant Professor in Geography at McGill University (and formerly held a Canada Research Chair in Eco-Meteorology at UBC). Her research investigates how wetland-atmosphere exchanges of GHG, water and energy fluxes respond to a changing climate and disturbance, and how we can modify wetland management practices for climate change adaptation and mitigation. Dr. Knox has made several important contributions to understanding the climatic role of conserving and restoring wetlands across North America, with a focus on restored peatlands, wetlands in the Prairie Pothole Region of Canada, and tidal wetlands. Dr. Knox also co-led the international FLUXNET-CH4 initiative, which is a global database of eddy covariance CH4 flux measurements.

Dr. Oliver Sonnentag is an Assistant Professor and holds the Canada Research Chair in Atmospheric Biogeosciences in High Latitudes at the Université de Montréal. His research aims to understand changes in land surface-atmosphere interactions in response to increasing natural and anthropogenic pressures. He has established a transect of eddy covariance towers along a 2000-km permafrost and climate gradient across the boreal forest of northwestern Canada. He also uses remote sensing and modelling techniques to study changes in Arctic-boreal ecosystem composition, structure, and function. In addition, Sonnentag leads a training network to build local Indigenous capacity in the Northwest Territories for community-based monitoring of ecosystem changes, and is a co-investigator in NSERC CREATE LEAP, “training tomorrow’s LEAders in Permafrost thaw and northern research”.

Dr. Vincent Maire is a Professor in Environmental Sciences at the Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières (UQTR). He formerly held a Junior Research Chair at UQTR in arctic functional ecology, focusing on the feedbacks of arctic vegetation changes on the dynamics of permafrost and soil functioning, including CO2 and CH4 fluxes. His research focuses on how properties and changes of vegetation and microbial communities modify soil cycling of C and nitrogen in arctic, temperate, dryland and wetland ecosystems. Since 2019, he has been involved in the Pole d’Expertise du Lac Saint-Pierre, which evaluates the role of agricultural disturbances on the functioning of the Lac Saint-Pierre shoreline. As part of this, he determined how agricultural disturbances have modified the sequestration of biomass and C into soils and the fluxes of CO2 and CH4 to the atmosphere.
